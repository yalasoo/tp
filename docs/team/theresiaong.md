### Project: LittleLogBook

LittleLogBook is a desktop contact management application designed specifically for Singapore kindergarten teachers to efficiently manage student and parent information. Adapted from AddressBook (Level 3), it features a CLI-centric interface optimized for keyboard-driven workflows in fast-paced educational environments.

The application was developed in Java over a 6-week engineering cycle, maintaining a clean codebase with no external dependencies while prioritizing robust functionality and user efficiency.
